# ABBYY SOLUTIONS
# Python
- I decided to fill docx pages by random beautiful pictures from the internet.
- ``images.py`` is file for downloading images (I use yandex.ru/images, but it's okey to choose another one). So it goes to given url and load ``num`` images.
- ``convert.py`` is file for converting ``.docx`` to ``.pdf``.
- ``word.py`` is main file for creating Document. It consists of ``num`` pages.
- You are free to download ``num`` images (this is the only argument to input).
- Result is ``example.pdf``
# C++
- Calculate figure's area (circle, triangle or rectangle).
- User should understand what coordinates he uses. If rectangle is chosen, then 3 coordinates has to form a right angle.
